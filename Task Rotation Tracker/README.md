# Task Rotation Tracker
A web application that helps manage your tasks in a "rotating order". I created this to keep track of the tasks I'm doing and ensure I maintain repetition cycles, which helps with memory retention about the topic of the task.


## Features
- Create and manage tasks with descriptions
- Organize tasks into groups
- Track task completion with timestamps and counts
- Assign priority levels to your tasks
- Monitor tasks completion
- Export/import task data as JSON for backup and transfer

## Installation
1. Download the HTML file to your computer
2. Open the file in any web browser
3. No other installation or server required

## How to use
1. Add new tasks with the form at the top
2. Assign priority levels (Low, Medium, High) to indicate importance
3. Organize tasks into groups for better categorization
4. Click "Done" when you complete a task (it moves to the end of the rotation)
5. Use the "Export Data" button to back up your tasks
6. Use the "Import Data" to restore from a backup or transfer to another device

## Future Plans
I will add new features as I need.
