# Website Blocker Extension
A simple browser extension that should help improve productivity by blocking distracting websites. I created this to prevent myself from playing online chess and accessing social networks, as I was wasting too much time on these sites.

## Features
- Block specific websites by URL

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to a folder on your computer
2. Open your browser and navigate to the extensions page e.g.:
    - Chrome: Menu → More Tools → Extensions or enter chrome://extensions/
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" or "Load Temporary Add-on"
5. Select the folder where you cloned the repository

## How to use
1. Click on the extension icon in your browser toolbar
2. In the Website Blocker popup add/remove a site

## Future Plans
If I find myself making the extension ineffective by frequently removing and then adding or disabling it, I plan to upgrade it.
